# Secondary structure of 34 circRNAs in PA1 cell line 
============================================

All structures are modeled by RNAfold with SHAPE value from circSHAPE-MaP data. 

Parameters: -p -d2 –circ –shape = SHAPE reactivity profile –shapeMethod = D < RNA.fa

Note:the parameters used in this study are different with RNAfold webserve defualt parameters.
